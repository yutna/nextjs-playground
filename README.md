# Next.js Playground

This repository is for storing examples and exercises done while studying Next.js. Besides serving as a backup, it is also used as a reference to revisit notes and records that I have kept.

## Prerequisites

I use these tools when practicing Next.js. If you need to run any file examples in this project, please ensure that these tools are installed before you begin.

- [Node.js][1]
- [Create Next App][2]

## Start Local Development

Since this project was created using `create-next-app`, you can start the local development server with the `npm run dev` command.
